          <div class="reflex"></div><h2>The Challenge of Poverty</h2>
            <p>
                Poverty, in its broadest sense, is more than just a lack of income and resources. It's a complex, multidimensional issue encompassing lack of access to basic necessities like food, clean water, healthcare, education, and social exclusion. **Eradicating extreme poverty** for all people everywhere is the first and foremost goal of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
            </p>
            <p>
                While significant progress has been made globally, billions still live in poverty, struggling for basic survival. The COVID-19 pandemic and recent conflicts have reversed decades of progress in the fight against poverty, making collective action more urgent than ever.

              <h2>Key Targets & Action</h2>
            <p>
                SDG 1 has seven core targets focusing on various aspects of poverty eradication. Key targets include reducing at least half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions by 2030, implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems, and ensuring equal rights to economic resources, ownership, and control over land.
            </p>
            <p>
                Achieving this goal requires strong collaboration between governments, the private sector, and civil society. Policies must be pro-poor and gender-sensitive, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations are prioritized in development efforts.
